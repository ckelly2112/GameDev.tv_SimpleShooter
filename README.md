This is the fourth and final Unreal udemy course created by GameDev.tv (Updated for UE4.25) 

Following this course I will begin working on my own product and periodically updating the last few projects as practice. 

As a reference, I already have an associate's degree in Computer Programming, but as I graduated just as the pandemic shut everything down I have been working to keep my brain focused on programming and learning new skills on my own while looking for work.
